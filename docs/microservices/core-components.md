- Integration with PagerDuty, Slack, email

## L. Infrastructure

### Kubernetes:

- Container orchestration
- Auto-scaling based on load
- Service discovery
- Configuration management
- Resource allocation

### Service Mesh (Istio):

- Service-to-service communication
- Traffic management
- Security policies
- Observability
- Circuit breaking

### CI/CD Pipeline:

- Automated testing
- Continuous integration
- Deployment automation
- Blue/green deployments
- Rollback capabilities

# Workflow Execution Flow

## 1. Workflow Creation:

- User designs workflow in visual builder
- System validates workflow integrity
- Workflow is versioned and stored

## 2. Trigger Activation:

- External event or scheduled trigger occurs
- Event is published to Kafka topic

## 3. Workflow Execution:

- Workflow Executor consumes event
- Executor loads workflow definition
- Steps are executed sequentially or in parallel
- State is maintained throughout execution

## 4. Integration Actions:

- Workflow calls third-party services via Integration Hub
- Data is transformed as needed
- Responses are processed according to workflow logic

## 5. Real-time Updates:

- Execution progress is published to Redis
- Real-time Service notifies clients via WebSockets
- UI updates with current status

## 6. Completion & Logging:

- Execution results are stored in MongoDB
- Analytics data is updated
- Notifications are sent if configured
- Logs are indexed in ELK stack

# Failure Handling & Resilience

- **Retry Strategy:** Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Circuit Breakers:** Prevent cascading failures when services are degraded
- **Dead Letter Queues:** Capture failed events for later processing
- **Fallback Mechanisms:** Define alternative paths when primary actions fail
- **State Recovery:** Ability to resume workflows from last successful step
- **Idempotency:** Ensure operations can be safely retried without side effects
- **Compensating Transactions:** Reverse previous steps when workflow fails

# Multi-tenancy & Enterprise Features

- **Tenant Isolation:** Complete separation of data and resources
- **Custom Domains:** Support for tenant-specific domains
- **White Labeling:** Customizable UI for enterprise clients
- **SSO Integration:** Support for enterprise identity providers
- **Compliance Features:** Audit logs, data retention policies, GDPR tools
- **Enterprise SLAs:** Guaranteed uptime and performance metrics
- **Advanced Security:** IP restrictions, MFA, security policies

# Scaling Strategy

- **Horizontal Scaling:** Add instances based on load
- **Database Sharding:** Partition data for large tenants
- **Caching Layers:** Reduce database load for common operations
- **Read Replicas:** Scale read operations independently
- **Geo-distribution:** Deploy in multiple regions for global performance
- **Stateless Services:** Enable easy scaling of application tier
- **Resource Quotas:** Prevent tenant resource monopolization

This architecture provides a robust foundation for an enterprise-level SAAS automation builder system, combining the strengths of Spring Boot for high-performance APIs and Node.js for real-time event processing.
