# Nano Pulse

This system will handle real-time data processing for:

- User Activity Tracking (logins, actions, interactions)
- Notifications (instant alerts, scheduled updates)
- Leaderboards (dynamic rankings based on real-time events)
- Analytics System (detailed event monitoring and reports)

## Core Requirements:

✅ Scalability & Performance:

- Use event-driven architecture to handle high traffic efficiently.
- Implement queueing systems (e.g., BullMQ, RabbitMQ, or Kafka) for processing events asynchronously.
- Use database sharding & indexing for optimized MongoDB queries.

✅ Webhook Features:

- Event Subscription System (allow clients to subscribe to specific events)
- Webhook Delivery with Retry Mechanism (exponential backoff & dead-letter queue)
- Secure Webhook Signature Verification (HMAC SHA256)
- Event Filtering & Transformation (process & modify payloads before delivery)
- Logging & Monitoring (track webhook delivery success/failure rates)
- Rate Limiting & Throttling (prevent abuse and ensure fair usage)
- Webhook Replay & Debugging (resend failed webhooks, inspect payloads)
- Multi-Tenant Support (isolate data for different clients)
- Custom Event Processing Rules (allow users to define business logic for webhooks)
- Batch Processing (group multiple events into a single webhook)

✅ Tech Stack & Architecture:

- Node.js + Express.js + TypeScript for the backend
- MongoDB (with Mongoose) for event storage
- Redis for caching and queuing
- BullMQ / RabbitMQ / Kafka for event queueing
- WebSockets / Socket.io for real-time updates
- Background Workers (to process heavy tasks asynchronously)
- API Gateway & Load Balancer (for horizontal scaling)
- Monitoring & Logging: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

✅ Performance Optimizations:

- Optimized database indexing & query strategies
- Batch inserts & bulk updates
- Efficient event deduplication & processing pipelines
- Microservices-friendly architecture for future scalability

✅ Security & Reliability:

- HMAC Signature Verification to prevent webhook tampering
- JWT Authentication & Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
- Rate Limiting & IP Whitelisting
- Audit Logs & Compliance Features
- High Availability & Disaster Recovery Strategy
